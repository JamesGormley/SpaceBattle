Naboo N-1 Royal Starfighter  (STAR WARS - Episode I)
--------------------------------------------------------------
3DS Version 2
--------------------------------------------------------------

New in version 2:
 - cleaned up the mesh for quicker rendering & interaction 
 - pylons are now integrated into the dorsal hull
   (like in the original film model)

As reference I used the 1:48 kit and about 60 images.

Since theres is no unique N-1 design, i mixed up
the design of the full sized model used for filming and
the computer models seen in Episode I.

I would be pleased if you send me a picture or an url if you 
use my model for web publishing.

If someone needs a low poly version write me an e-mail:
